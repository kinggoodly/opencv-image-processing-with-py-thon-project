# opencv-image-processing-with-py-thon-project
this is project about object detection for an item in convenient store (snack , berverage ,candy)
my main purpose is for create new faster way for payment system cause i think the way that we used (sacan the barcode of product one by one and then calculate the price) is to slow
so my idea is use obeject detection for classification an item and calculate them in real time
